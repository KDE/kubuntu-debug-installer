kubuntu-debug-installer (10.10ubuntu5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Remove pointless include documentation
  * Fix include style
  * Improve looks of license headers
  * Introduce new thread signal alreadyInstalled which will be used to
    increment if a dbg package is already installed
  * Do not pointlessly copy QStrings around in signals and slots
  * Do not list already installed packages, instead emit alreadyInstalled
    and ignore the package (by Felix Geyer)
  * Introduce a boolean state tracker whether we found an already installed
    dbg package, if it is true and we have neither dbg packages nor missing
    ones exit with no error is indicated to prevent errors from appearing.
    Otherwise the bool is ignore completely.
  * Use qApp->exit to end the event loop instead of plain exit() 
  * Set version string using supreme cmake magic
  * Get rid of thread. Instead we now have DebugFinder which is a QObject
    essentially exposing the same signals&slots that the old thread exposed.
    Now such a finder gets constructed in the installer and move to a thread
    of which then the event loop starts. That way no blocking whatsoever
    occurs in the GUI as long as all interaction with the finde happens via
    the event loop (except that it is very non-blocking thanks to QApt
    already)
  * Bump standards version to 3.9.1
  * Add Jonathan Thomas and Felix Geyer as copyright holders in debian/copyright

kubuntu-debug-installer (10.04ubuntu4) lucid; urgency=low

  * Don't offer installation of already installed packages (LP: #538543)
  * Changer lookup order (dbgsym first, dbg last). This way the user does not
    end up with a mixed setup of dbgsym and dbg. Of course this only works if
    the user does not install -dbg manually! Unfortunately a more specific
    approach wil have to wait for libqapt or the likes, since the current
    query design would make the lookups too expensive (LP: #540505)

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * Prevent dialogs from appearing when there are no dbg packages found at
    all (using function checkListEmpty which exits the app on empty list)
